### The Rust-like language you never knew you needed

Picture this: you're on a run on a beautiful day in perfect weather on a lovely beach. Suddenly you come across a large
heap of trash. This is your mind on Rust.

Now picture this: you're on a run on a beautiful day in perfect weather on a lovely beach. In the distance you see
somebody else coming across a large heap of trash; what's that? They're wading through piles of `::`, `` `a`` `||()`, `
Ref<>`, and `Box<>`'s? It sure is nice that your Axon beach is all fresh air, clean sand, and pure water!

## The Axon Manifesto

1. Memory safety shouldn't have an aesthetic cost.
2. Implicitness is the root of all evil.
3. Backwards compatability is the deeper root of all evil.
